options for priors

1. carrying over the raw posterior data, from m1 to m2
in this case, we should not use response data from m1 in m2

2. not carrying over the raw posterior data,
but reusing the prior mean/sd that was used in the beginning of m1, to m2
in this case, we should carryover response data from m1 to m2

both options are mathematically equivalent
